# 🌍 Week 00 – Why Cloud Networking?

## 🎯 Objective

Before diving into AWS, Azure, or GCP networking, it is critical to understand:

- Why cloud networking exists
- What business problems it solves
- How it differs from traditional networking
- Why network engineers must adapt

---

# 🏢 Evolution of Infrastructure

## Traditional Data Center Model

- Physical routers and switches
- MPLS WAN connectivity
- Hardware firewalls
- Manual provisioning
- Long deployment cycles

Scaling required:
- Purchasing hardware
- Waiting for circuit provisioning
- Manual configuration

---

## Cloud Infrastructure Model

Cloud providers such as:

- Amazon Web Services (AWS)
- Microsoft Azure
- Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

Offer:

- On-demand compute
- Global data centers
- Elastic scaling
- Software-defined networking

Infrastructure can now be deployed in minutes instead of weeks.

# 🔗 Relationship Between Cloud and Networking

Cloud is built on top of massive distributed networks.

Networking provides:

- Isolation (VPC / VNet)
- Routing (Control plane decisions)
- Connectivity (VPN, Peering, Direct connections)
- Security (Firewall policies, segmentation)
- High Availability (Multi-region design)

Without networking, cloud services cannot communicate securely or reliably.

# ❗ Problems Cloud Networking Solves

## 1️⃣ Faster Deployment

Traditional:
Weeks to deploy infrastructure.

Cloud:
Minutes to create virtual networks.

---

## 2️⃣ Global Expansion

Traditional:
New data center required physical presence.

Cloud:
Deploy workloads in multiple regions instantly.

---

## 3️⃣ Flexible Connectivity

Traditional:
Expensive MPLS circuits.

Cloud:
IPSec VPN
Dedicated private connections
Multi-cloud connectivity

---

## 4️⃣ Elastic Scaling

Traditional:
Hardware upgrade required.

Cloud:
Add subnets and scale services dynamically.

# 🔄 Traditional Networking vs Cloud Networking

| Traditional | Cloud |
|------------|--------|
| Hardware-based | Software-defined |
| CLI-driven | API-driven |
| Manual scaling | Elastic scaling |
| Physical routing devices | Managed distributed fabric |
| Static provisioning | On-demand provisioning |

---

# 🧠 Mindset Shift for Network Engineers

Old Role:
Configure routers and switches.

New Role:
Design secure, scalable connectivity architectures.

Cloud networking is not replacing networking —
it is transforming how networking is delivered.

# 🚀 Course Journey Ahead

This course will transition you from:

On-Prem Network Engineer ➜ Multi-Cloud Networking Professional

You will learn:

- Cloud-native network design
- Hybrid connectivity architecture
- Routing behavior in AWS, Azure, and GCP
- Multi-cloud design patterns
- Real-world troubleshooting scenarios

---

# 📌 Key Takeaway

Cloud is someone else's data center.

Networking is still the backbone.

Understanding routing, control plane logic, and architecture principles makes cloud networking straightforward.
